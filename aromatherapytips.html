                <h2>Tip 1: Calming Lavender</h2>
                <p>ULavender oil
                    Lavender is Dr. Lin’s go-to oil. “It’s gentle and has a lot of benefits. You can use it in a variety
                    of ways,” she says.

                    Try adding it to a bath or diffuser as aromatherapy, adding to water to make a room spray or body
                    spritzer, or combining with a base oil to make body oil.

                    Lavender can help with stress, pain and sleep. “Before the discovery of antiseptics, lavender was
                    also used as a cleaning agent in hospitals,” Dr. Lin says.

                    There have also been studies that show using lavender oil (and tea tree oil) can potentially disrupt
                    hormones in young boys.</p>

                <h2>Tip 2 teatree oil</h2>
                <p>Tea tree oil
                    Dr. Lin says most people use tea tree oil as an antiseptic, antimicrobial or antifungal. You can
                    also use it to help with:

                    Acne. “Take a cotton swab and dip it into tea tree essential oil. Then, apply it directly on the
                    acne — this is one exception where you don’t have to dilute it,” says Dr. Lin. “It can help resolve
                    acne faster.”
                    Athlete’s foot and ringworms. “Dilute it with a carrier oil (a base or vegetable oil like coconut or
                    jojoba oil that helps dilute essential oils) and put the blend on the affected skin.”
                    One note of caution: Since tea tree oil can be neurotoxic, Dr. Lin says you shouldn’t diffuse it if
                    you have small children or animals at home.</p>

                <h2>Tip 2 Frankincense oil</h2>
                <p>Known as the “king of oils,” frankincense can help with inflammation, mood and sleep. Studies have
                    shown that it can also improve asthma and might prevent gum disease.

                    Frankincense oil has a woody, spicy scent and can be used as aromatherapy and can be found in skin
                    creams. Makes sure you dilute frankincense oil before applying it to your skin.</p>

                <h2>Tip 2 Peppermint oil</h2>
                <p>Peppermint oil is known to:

                    Be an anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antimicrobial.<br><br>
                    Ease headaches.<br><br>
                    Fight fatigue.<br><br>
                    Lift mood.<br><br>
                    Reduce gut spasms.<br><br>
                    Support digestion.<br><br>
                    Support memory.<br><br>
                    “Peppermint tea can settle your stomach, too, if you have irritable bowel syndrome or gastric
                    irritation,” adds Dr. Lin. “It’s very gentle and easy to use.”

                    When using the oil topically, make sure you dilute it.</p></div><br><br>

                        <h2>Tip 2 Eucalyptus oil</h2>
                        <p>Eucalyptus is a great essential oil to have on hand during cold season. It soothes a
                            stuffed-up nose by opening your nasal passages so you can breathe easier. (Peppermint oil
                            can also help with this.)

                            It can also relieve pain and fight against herpes simplex virus thanks to its antimicrobial
                            and anti-inflammatory properties.

                            Take precautions when using eucalyptus oil, making sure to dilute it before applying
                            topically. It should not be ingested and can have dangerous side effects on children and
                            pets.</p><br><br><br><br>
